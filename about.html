                                Thanks for visiting my website! Let me tell you a
                                little bit
                                about myself, but also feel free to skip to the

                            <p>
                                My journey into UX was inspired by my experience
                                working in the
                                restaurant industry. A common pain point among
                                bartenders and wait staff is the feeling that their point of sale
                                app isn’t as
                                efficient as they need it to be, and while
                                waiting or
                                bartending, time is money, so it’s a frustrating
                                feeling when
                                you believe the tool you’re using is affecting
                                your bottom line. So who designs these things?

                    <p>Are they people with restaurant experience themselves? If not, how does someone who doesn’t have subject matter experience design an intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable tool for people who are experts in it? My curiosity led me to read Don Norman’s celebrated book <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> and I’ve been following the gospel of human-centered design ever since.</p>

                    <h3>Where I chose to learn about it</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was lucky enough to find UX design early in my
                        undergrad program
                        at the University of Maryland, so I’ve been able to
                        enroll in
                        pretty much every design class the school has to offer.
                        Courses
                        such as Advanced Interaction Design, User-centered
                        Design, Visual
                        Design Studio, and Prototyping and Development Studio
                        have given
                        me the tools I need to perform through the entire design
                        process,
                        from strategy to research, to UI, and beyond - and since
                        it’s the
                        iSchool, I’m no stranger to coding languages!
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>What I’m interested in</h3>

                    <p>
                        As a UI/UX designer, I’ve focused most of my learning
                        and practice
                        on creating web and product experiences, but I also have
                        a strong
                        interest in using my skills in game design. A course at
                        the
                        University of Maryland called “Games as Emergent
                        Experiences”
                        opened my eyes to the exciting overlap between the
                        frameworks,
                        philosophies, and goals of game, and UX, design. Game
                        designers
                        and game academics like James Paul Gee, Robin Hunicke,
                        and Kurt
                        Squire have been a huge inspiration to my ongoing
                        learning as a
                        UI/UX designer, and with a body of work being expanding
                        so quickly
                        in both fields, it’s exciting to be in the middle
                        absorbing the
                        best from both!
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h3>How I keep up</h3>

                    <p>
                        I’m currently honing my skills in game UI design with
                        practice
                        projects. I’m also involved with a community of game
                        designers and
                        game-enthused UXer’s through DIA Design Guild LLC, where
                        I
                        apprentice. The community is an arm of DIA, and a place
                        where
                        apprentices and mentors can get together to learn about,
                        and
                        practice, making games. I’m in the process of learning
                        Unity to
                        expand my skill set and to help me create my first game!
